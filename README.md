# movie-app-frontend

A simple movie app built with React, TypeScript, and react-query. The app displays movies, their relevant information, and utilizes infinite scrolling.

## Motivation

The primary motivation behind this project was to learn and explore the use of react-query in a React project for efficient data fetching, caching, and error handling. Another goal was to implement infinite scrolling for a seamless browsing experience while exploring movies.
